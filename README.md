🎥 Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains a Python-based movie recommendation system implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The model uses machine learning techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences, offering a personalized and engaging experience.

📌 Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies based on attributes such as genre, director, and ratings.
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for enhanced accuracy.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn for machine learning models
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
surprise library for collaborative filtering
🚀 How It Works
Data Input:

Loads a dataset of movies and user ratings.
Preprocesses the data for feature extraction and cleaning.
Model Training:

Implements collaborative filtering to learn from user behavior.
Uses content-based filtering for recommending similar movies.
Recommendation:

Provides a list of movies tailored to user preferences.
